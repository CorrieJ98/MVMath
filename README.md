# MVMath

My custom matrix and vector library built for use within my
game engine.

This is very much a work in progress and is - as of right now - a shambles.

I do not recommend using this as a basis for any project other than educational use
as it is vastly unstable, prone to fatal errors and janky.

I love it though because I built it :)
